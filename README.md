## E-commerce UI

## Created a themed shopping application sample made with React. Used custom styling instead of normally using framework like Bootstrap, if I had more time I would fix responsiveness, color theme, and add in more features.

## Features:

- Fetches from json file to load store data
- User is able to hover over product card to "Add to cart"
- Click on art palette icon to change theme/layout of application to dark mode, used Sass mixins

## To do:

- Fitler/Sort
- Toggle Shopping cart as a modal on nav bar top right instead of to the right/left of UI

## Install:

`git clone repo`
`cd repo`
`npm install` && `npm start`
