## E-commerce UI

Created a themed shopping application sample UI made with React. Used custom styling instead of normally using framework like Bootstrap/Material, if I had more time I would fix responsiveness, create more modern/uniform theme, and add in more features.

### Features:

- Fetches from json file to load store data
- User is able to hover over product card to "Add to cart" and remove from cart
- Click on art palette icon ðŸŽ¨ to change theme/layout of application to dark mode, used Sass mixins, theme is held in state, renders dynamically on toggle

### To do:

- Fix styling for buttons and theme
- Fitler/Sort features
- Toggle Shopping cart as a modal on nav bar top right instead of to the right/left of UI

### Install:

- `git clone https://github.com/diaaanek/e-comm.git`
- `cd e-comm`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
